# priceAccQA
This repository functions as a QA agent for my work at MySmartPrice.

So, The aim of this project is to

1. Go to our website ( www.mysmartprice.com )
2. Grab some random products ( preferably just in fashion -- my area )
3. get the price displayed there
4. get the stock displayed there
5. Go to the sellers website for the same product
6. Compare the prices.
7. Do this for atleast 50 products in each store.
8. Mail me the report


Hopefully I will see this to completion in a couple of days.
